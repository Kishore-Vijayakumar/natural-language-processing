# Machine Learning and NLP Projects

## Project 1: Blog Author Multi-Label Classification

### Overview
This project involves building an NLP classifier to predict multiple attributes (e.g., age, gender, industry) of blog authors based on their text. The data includes over 600,000 blog posts from 19,320 authors.

### Features
- **Domain**: Digital Content Management
- **Objective**: Classify text into multiple labels to infer author attributes.
- **Data Source**: [Kaggle Blog Authorship Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus)
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, vectorization, etc.).
  2. Train and test a text classification model.
  3. Evaluate performance with classification reports and display predictions.

## Project 2: Customer Support Chatbot

### Overview
This project creates a semi-rule-based chatbot to handle generic customer support requests. The chatbot answers predefined queries or redirects complex requests to human support.

### Features
- **Domain**: Customer Support
- **Objective**: Automate support request handling with a Python-based chatbot.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Design a chatbot for dynamic query handling and responses.
  2. Integrate a corpus for automated replies.
  3. Continuously engage with users until the session is ended.

## Project 3: IMDB Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This project uses a deep learning model to classify customer sentiments (positive/negative) based on their IMDB reviews. Preprocessed data is used to train a sequential NLP classifier.

### Features
- **Domain**: Digital Content and Entertainment
- **Objective**: Analyze customer sentiments using movie reviews.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Load and preprocess IMDB data.
  2. Train, tune, and evaluate a sequential NLP model.
  3. Analyze performance using embedding layers and classification metrics.

## Project 4: Sarcasm Detection

### Overview
This project aims to detect sarcasm in news headlines using Bidirectional LSTM models. The dataset is collected from formal news websites, ensuring high-quality labels and reduced noise.

### Features
- **Domain**: Social Media Analytics
- **Objective**: Build a sarcasm detection model using deep learning.
- **Data Source**: [News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection)
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Preprocess data and create embeddings using GloVe.
  2. Train and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM model.
  3. Analyze and visualize results.
